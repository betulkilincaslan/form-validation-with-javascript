### Form Validation

- I developed an application that checks if the form is valid.

### Live Demo :

https://form-validation-with-javascript-app.netlify.app/

## Rules

1- It will throw an error when the username, password and email are empty.

2- Password will be a minimum of 8 characters.

3- If @ is not used in the email, it will give an error.

4- All errors will be shown in input-specific fields and error messages will be specific to that field.

5- When the submit button is clicked, an error will be given if the inputs are empty and the error under the filled input will be dynamically destroyed.
